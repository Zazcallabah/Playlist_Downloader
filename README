# pldl

This script will, given a href to a m3u playlist:

1) download that playlist
2) assume that it contains more playlists
3) download the first playlist it contains (or, if specified, the second, third etc.)
4) download all files in the second-tier playlist
5) concatenate those files together into one big file.


# leech & joinfile
leech: grab m3u8 files out of a harfile, download an audio and video stream into separate folders

joinfile: stitch the two sets of files together by concatenation then ffmpeg remux into single container


# ffmpeg-wrapper
just a reference to basic ffmpeg single-stream compression and remuxing
